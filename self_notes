Semantic html: All contents on the top bar of the page have been 
encased in a <header> tag. Additionally, the <body> tag has been 
moved lower, starting at the top image rather than starting at the
top bar which should be the header. 

Html structuring: everything is tagged with a <div> tag, it's difficult 
for a coder to read it and know what's happening, replace them with
<p> tags 

Image elements: make sure they have alts (a text popup in place of an
image to display should the image fail to load)

Heading attributes: have the headings show up in sequential order 

Title element: add one
